# About Me

I'm **Aaron Zuspan**, a research fellow at the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station where I use **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **open-source** software to [study](/research) post-fire forests. Sometimes I build [things](/projects), and sometimes I [write](/blog) about:

- 🐍 [Python](/tag/python)
- 🧮 [Algorithms](/tag/algorithms)
- ⚙️ [Earth Engine](/tag/earth-engine)
