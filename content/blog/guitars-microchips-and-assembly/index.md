My first attempts at programming were writing hacky embedded C++ to run Arduino microcontrollers, brute forcing my way through compiler errors to try to make LEDs blink and motors spin. These days I write most of my code in high-level, dynamically-typed languages, but there's still something alluring about that intersection of software and hardware - about watching your code run in the physical world.

So, leaving behind the comfort of high-level abstractions and garbage-collected memory management, I spent a few days diving back into the world of low-level embedded code by building a guitar effects pedal around the [FV-1](http://www.spinsemi.com/products.html) chip. Because what's lower level than Assembly?

## A Quick Intro to Guitar Effects

Guitars make sounds[^citation-needed]. Sometimes you want those sounds to be different. Throw the sound at a transistor until the transistor stops working right and you get [distortion](https://www.eeeguide.com/transistor-clipper-circuit-and-waveforms/). Use the sound to shake a spring and listen to the other side of the spring and you get [reverb](https://producerhive.com/ask-the-hive/how-does-spring-reverb-work/). Pass the sound through a conductive liquid that's rocking back and forth to modulate resistance and you get [tremolo](https://www.premierguitar.com/late-1940s-dearmond-601-tremolo). These are analog effects. No code, just physics.

We're programmers, not electrical engineers, so what about digital effects? Pass a sound through a special type of computer called a digital signal processor (DSP) that's designed to run at a fast, consistent clock speed, and you can get all kinds of effects using software instead of hardware.

## The Hardware

Okay, we do need *some* hardware. The [FV-1](http://spinsemi.com/knowledge_base/arch.html) is a chip designed for guitar effects like reverb, delay, and compression that's found its way into [a bunch of high-end pedals](https://reverb.com/news/fv-1-chip-history-5-pedals) because it's cheap and flexible. That popularity has led to [open source tools](https://github.com/HolyCityAudio/SpinCAD-Designer), [premade programs](https://mstratman.github.io/fv1-programs/), and [development boards](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/fv1dev/) that make it much easier to get started for a DSP beginner like me.

I picked up a [development board](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/fv1dev/) (chip included), some EEPROM chips to store programs, and a handful of resistors, capacitors, ICs, and switches, and spent a morning soldering the kit together into a working[^working-pedal] pedal.

Now let's make it make noises.

## The Firmware

To write code for the FV-1, we'll need to speak its language, [SPINAsm](http://www.spinsemi.com/Products/datasheets/spn1001-dev/SPINAsmUserManual.pdf), but before we get familiar with the specific [instructions and syntax](http://www.spinsemi.com/knowledge_base/inst_syntax.html), it's worth a quick overview of the basic principles of assembly.

### Registers, Accumulators, and Opcodes

Fundamentally, assembly languages are all about using **instructions** to modify and move data in and out of **registers**.

**Instructions** tell the processor what to do, and they're made of an **opcode** (the name of the instruction) and **arguments** (the parameters used by the instruction).

**Registers** are memory locations where you can access input data, store intermediate calculations, or send output data. The **accumulator**[^accumulator] is a special register that's used to store data that you're actively working with.



### Hello World

With those definitions in mind, let's write the simplest FV-1 program possible. It takes the input signal and outputs it unchanged:

```text
;---Hello world!---
LDAX ADCL
WRAX DACL, 0.0
```

In the first line (after our comment), we use the `LDAX` instruction to read a value from the `ADCL` register (left channel pedal input) and store it in the accumulator. On the second line, the `WRAX` instruction writes the value that we just stored in the accumulator to the `DACL` register (left channel pedal output) and multiplies it by 0.0 to reset it.

If we ran this program, the FV-1 would read the guitar signal and send it unchanged to the output, once every clock cycle (about 32k times per second).

### A Boost Pedal

With a few small changes, we can make this program _slightly_ useful. Instead of outputting the input signal unchanged, let's boost the gain and then multiply it by a potentiometer value, creating a basic adjustable clean boost pedal.

```text
;---Boost pedal---
RDAX ADCL, 1.9
MULX POT0
WRAX DACL, 0.0
```

Like `LDAX`, the `RDAX` opcode reads a value into the accumulator, but it takes a second argument which the accumulator is multiplied with. Multiplying by `1.9` will give a volume boost. Next, the `MULX` opcode multiplies the accumulator by a specified value--in this case, the value read from the special `POT0` register that stores the output of the first potentiometer on the development board.

The result is that we can adjust the volume of our input signal between 0 and 1.9x the original volume.

### A Tremolo Pedal

For the final example, let's build a basic tremolo. A tremolo is effectively a volume pedal controlled by an oscillator instead of a potentiometer, so this will build off of the previous example while introducing the low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) built-in to the FV-1. This program is a little more complicated, so I broke it into 3 sections.

#### 1. Setup

The LFO will provide an oscillating sine-wave that we'll use to modulate guitar volume, but it needs to be initialized before we can use it. We can accomplish that with the `WLDS` opcode. We'll pass it the name of the LFO we want to initialize, a placeholder frequency value of 0 (we'll set this later using a potentiometer), and the LFO amplitude that will define the tremolo depth. We'll use the maximum amplitude of `32767` and control the strength of the effect using the wet/dry mix potentiometer built into the development board.

We only want to run this initialization once at the start of the program, so we'll put a `SKP` instruction before it that tells the FV-1 to only execute the next instruction once.

```text
; Setup
SKP RUN, 1
WLDS SIN0, 0, 32767
```

#### 2. Controls

The LFO is running now, but we'd like to be able to adjust the rate with a potentiometer. We'll do that by reading `POT0` into the accumulator and storing it in the special `SIN0_RATE` register. To keep the rate in a reasonable range, we'll use the `SOF` opcode to multiply the accumulator by `0.5` and add `0.1`.

```text
; Controls
LDAX POT0
SOF 0.5, 0.1
WRAX SIN0_RATE, 0
```

#### 3. Modulation

Finally, we'll use the LFO to modulate the volume of our input signal. The `CHO RDAL` opcode reads the LFO into the accumulator. The LFO value is in the range [-1, 1], so the `SOF` opcode will rescale the accumulator to the [0, 1] range we need. Finally, we can use the familiar `MULX` and `WRAX` opcodes to multiply the iwrite_outputnput signal by the re-scaled LFO value and write it to the output.

```text
; Main loop
CHO RDAL, SIN0
SOF 0.5, 0.5
MULX ADCL
WRAX DACL, 0.0
```

## Putting It All Together

Here is our finished tremolo program:

```text
;---Tremolo---
SKP RUN, 1
WLDS SIN0, 0, 32767

LDAX POT0
SOF 0.5, 0.1
WRAX SIN0_RATE, 0

CHO RDAL, SIN0
SOF 0.5, 0.5
MULX ADCL
WRAX DACL, 0.0
```

Now we just need to get it onto our pedal. The dev board I used has a built-in USB programmer that lets you flash programs to the onboard EEPROM memory, so the process is as simple as 1) assemble the program to binary[^asfv1], 2) install the necessary software and drivers[^programmer], 3) plug the pedal in to USB and power, and 4) flash the program.

How does it sound?

Like a tremolo! Not bad for a day of hacking.

## Useful Resources for Learning FV-1

Want to learn more about the FV-1? These were some useful resources I came across.

- The [manual](http://www.spinsemi.com/Products/datasheets/spn1001-dev/SPINAsmUserManual.pdf) and [datasheet](http://www.spinsemi.com/Products/datasheets/spn1001/FV-1.pdf). Nitty and gritty, but good reference material.
- [SpinCAD Designer](https://github.com/HolyCityAudio/SpinCAD-Designer), an open-source Java GUI for building programs with drag-and-drop blocks. Seeing how block diagrams translate to assembly is very helpful, but the outputs aren't always optimized.
- The official [FV-1 forums](http://www.spinsemi.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3&sid=09c5e42db9d9c61470e3c7d445324dcc). Not very active, but some good threads to read through.
- The [Patreon blog](https://www.patreon.com/holycityaudio/posts) of SpinCAD's designer. Some materials are patron-only and new patrons aren't being accepted, but there are a lot of good free articles about both SpinCAD and FV-1 programming.
- A great guide for [getting started](https://electric-canary.com/fv1start.html). Basically like what I wrote, but better.
- A high-level guide to [designing and building](https://medium.com/@hipsters_unite/designing-the-atom-smasher-spin-fv1-pedal-1c63ad3b3f8e) an FV-1 pedal.
